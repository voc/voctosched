This has led to a lot of projects adopting it to reduce regressions and maintenance costs to the point of almost bankrupting Freedesktop.org! The only downside of the current testing infrastructure is that it is meant to run in the cloud, not on the GPUs we develop drivers for! Of course, some efforts are underway to make even the DRM subsystem testable in the cloud (VKMS) but if we are to prevent regressions through pre-merge testing, we need at some point to run on the real hardware!\r\n\r\nHardware-testing labs do exists, but they rarely seem to happen without a corporation to back them up as only they have the resources to pay for the development of the system interfacing with the hardware, its hosting, and its maintenance. In order to be within the reach of hobbyist projects, we estimate the cost should be limited to $1kUSD, one week-end of hardware set up time, and a couple of evenings of tweaking before reaching stability, and no more than an hour per week of maintenance after that. To reach this goal, we need to make the deployment as easy as assembling plastic bricks, keep maintenance costs down through self-configuration\/healing, and running Gitlab CI jobs in the farm as easy as inheriting from a CI template and setting a couple of environment variables!\r\n\r\nWhile we have not yet fully reached this loafty goal, we already are operating 3 farms in 3 locations with the above properties mostly implemented \\o\/ In this talk, we are presenting how easy it is to deploy a kernel and run containers in our farm, show what it takes to set up a test farm at home, and what can be done to get hobbyist projects like Nouveau tested!",

It holds special promise for GPUs due to common architectural features like dynamic register sharing, but there are also challenges in real-world implementations. After first being used in Mesa by the ACO compiler backend for AMD GPUs, it is now also in use by the Freedreno driver for Qualcomm Adreno GPUs. In this talk we will explain the basic concepts, considerations for real-world implementations, and implementation choices made in freedreno and ACO.",

The system information APIs in Wine will use the CPU performance scaling interfaces to manage the multi-core processor schedule timing compatibilities from windows application to Linux environment for VKD3D-Proton (the full Direct3D 12 API on top of Vulkan) on Steam. The original CPU performance scaling module is based on the legacy kernel common ACPI cpufreq driver on AMD processors. We found it was not very performance\/power efficiency for modern AMD platforms. So this talk is to introduce a new CPU performance scaling design for AMD platform which has better performance per watt scaling on such as 3D game like Horizon Zero Dawn with VKD3D-Proton on Steam. \r\n\r\nThe idea is inspired by co-working with Valve software guys for tuning animation slow down problem (https:\/\/github.com\/ValveSoftware\/Proton\/issues\/4125) of VKD3D-Proton on steam.",

While conformance tests are mostly narrow and confined, finding driver problems when running triple-A games can be a challenging task.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show a major misrendering example when running a game and the steps taken to pinpoint the underlying problem in shader compilation using RenderDoc. We will briefly touch the taxonomy of different issues, typical causes, and generic methods to try.",

In this scenario, it is critical to have a low-level API that can easily support and adapt to any device, in order to minimize the impact in upper-levels of the software stack when exposing novel hardware capabilities to higher-level programming models and frameworks.\r\n\r\nLevel-Zero API, part of Intel OneAPI product, defines a device-independent, vendor-agnostic, low-level, direct-to-metal interface to accelerator devices that abstracts users and upper-level components of the software stack from the specifics of the target devices, while providing them with the access needed to fully exploit their hardware capabilities. This is essential for Intel to expose new hardware features at a faster pace and to effectively compete against established CUDA-based ecosystem from NVIDIA.\r\n\r\nThis presentation offers an overview of the rich set of interfaces defined in Level-Zero, focusing on capabilities such as unified-shared memory, peer-to-peer communication, and inter-process communication. Additionally, the status of the implementation of Level-Zero and its adoption by higher-level compiler, analysis tools, performance libraries and other frameworks are presented.",

Indeed, the component we want to test often sends the pixels to an external display without any way to retrieve the image being output, let alone make sure it's correct.\r\n\r\nAnd while a human can perform some of those tests by looking at the screen, some issues can prove to be difficult to spot, such as colours being slightly off or pixels being offset. More complex tests can also be tedious to set up or hard to trigger.\r\n\r\nThe ecosystem of devices that Linux supports also adds further constraints on the display interfaces we want to test, but also on the system size, the tools available, the connectivity of the device, etc. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will first discuss the constraints and what makes testing the display stack unique. We will then talk about the existing solutions, their limitations, and what we have been working on to improve the situation.",

                    "description":"CRIU a.k.a Checkpoint Restore in Userspace is the de-facto choice for Checkpoint and Restore but one of its major limitations is to Checkpoint and Restore tasks that have a device state associated with them and need the driver to manage their state which CRIU cannot control but provides a flexible plugin mechanism to achieve this. So far there is no serious real device plugin (at least in public domain) that deals with a complex device such as a GPU. We would like to discuss our work to support CRIU with AMD ROCm which is AMD's fully open source solution to Machine Learning and HPC compute space. This will potentially be extended to support video decode \/ encode using render nodes.\r\n\r\nCRIU already has a plugin architecture to support processes using device files. Using this architecture we added a plugin for supporting CRIU with GPU compute applications running on the AMD ROCm software stack. This requires new ioctls in the KFD kernel mode driver to save and restore hardware and kernel mode driver state, such as memory mappings, VRAM contents, user mode queues, and signals. We also needed a few new plugin hooks in CRIU itself to support remapping of device files and mmap offsets within them, and finalizing GPU virtual memory mappings and resuming execution of the GPU after all VMAs have been restored by the PIE code.\r\n\r\nThe result is the first real-world plugin and the first example of GPU support in CRIU.\r\n\r\nWhile there were several new challenges that we faced to enable this work, we were finally able to support real tensorflow\/pytorch work loads across multi-gpu nodes using criu and were also able to migrate the containers running gpu bound worklaods.In this talk, we'd like to talk about our journey where we started with a small 64KB buffer object in GPU VRAM to Gigabytes of single VRAM buffer objects across GPUs. We started with \/PROC\/PID\/MEM interface initially and then switched to a faster direct approach that only worked with large PCIE BAR GPUs but that was still slow. For instance, to copy 16GB of VRAM, it used to take ~15 mins with the direct approach on large bars and more than 45 mins with small bars. We then switched to using system DMA engines built into most AMD GPus and this resulted in very significant improvements. We can checkpoint the same amount of data within 5 seconds now. For this we initially modified libdrm but the maintainers didn't agree to change an private API to expose GEM handles to the userspace so we finally ended up make a kernel change and exporting the buffer objects in VRAM as DMABUF objects and then import in our plugin using libdrm.\r\n\r\nWe are going to present the architecture of our plugin, how it interacts with CRIU and our GPU driver during the checkpoint and restore flow. We can also talk about some security considerations and initial test results and performance stats.\r\n \r\n\r\nFurther reading: https:\/\/github.com\/RadeonOpenCompute\/criu\/tree\/criu-dev\/plugins\/amdgpu#readme \r\nOur work-in-progress code: https:\/\/github.com\/RadeonOpenCompute\/criu\/tree\/amd-criu-dev-staging",

A crash in the compositor can take down the entire session and lead to data loss.\r\n\r\nWith wayland being a constantly changing landscape and with more workload being put on the compositor process this doesn't seem to be going away.\r\n\r\nThis talk showcases work across multiple libraries and toolkits to tackle this at the root with a method of \"compositor handoffs\" allowing clients to safely securely and seamlessly reconnect to a relaunched wayland compositor. This not only tackles the issue of robustness but also opens up a whole avenue of new opportunities that were previously impossible; such as freezing and resuming applications.\r\n\r\nWe talk through the POC implementations made across multiple toolkits, and what changes are needed throughout wayland and mesa to support this.",

They all aim for hardware accelerated video decoding and encoder with the Vulkan API.  In this talk, we will introduce the basics of video decoding and give an overview of the concepts used to decode video via the new Vulkan extension, using as example the usage of the API in a GStreamer element. The talk will be educational and focus on helping others in the X\/Mesa community to understand the new API concepts.",
