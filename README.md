Tool converting various formats to [frab](https://github.com/frab/frab)-style schedule XML and JSON as described by [in the c3voc wiki](https://c3voc.de/wiki/schedule). The format was initialy introduced by [pentabarf](https://github.com/nevs/pentabarf), got more popular with [frab](https://frab.github.io/frab/) and is also provided by [[https://pretalx.com/p/about/|pretalx]] â€“ as it became the main interexchange format [between various systems](https://c3voc.de/wiki/api) recording and publishing talks of conferences and other events.


This repository implements an object representation of the frab data model and can be used to build different im-/exporters or manipulators.

There is also a number of application which can display the schedule on mobile devices or infoscreens.
Some examples are:

More information about the format, and other tools with different approaches can be found on https://c3voc.de/wiki/schedule#conversion_tools
